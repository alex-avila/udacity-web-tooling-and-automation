# Gulp & Browsersync Practice

Super simple project with a super basic implementation of gulp and browsersync. I built this project to practice what I was studying for in my Udacity course for *Web Tooling and Automation*. I'm not sure how much I'll use this in the future because of tools like webpack, create-react-app, vue-cli, etc., but it's probably good to know.
